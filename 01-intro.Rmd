# Research plan

## Purpose

This book exists as a repository for my research process. The intent is to keep the ideas, discoveries and processes all in one place. This section discusses the context and larger project. The next sections show the thought process behind the progress so far in the data gathering phase. The book also includes a section on the courses that I plan to take and whose assignments I will include here.
