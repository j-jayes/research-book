# Research plan

## Purpose

This book exists as a repository for my research process. The intent is to keep the ideas, discoveries and processes all in one place. This section discusses the context and larger project. The next sections show the thought process behind the progress so far in the data gathering phase. The book also includes a section on the courses that I plan to take and whose assignments I will include here.

## Project

The research will form part of the project "Praise the poeple or praise the place: how culture and specialization drive long-term regional growth".

The project is about using micro-level data to better understand the mechanisms that drive long-term regional growth.

### Persistence and path-dependence in Sweden

The path of history can be interrupted by many different kinds of shocks. Some Swedish examples include the expansion of railway lines or the establishment of towns at the bequest of a king. These shocks can have lasting consequences that reach from history into the present day. A wealth of economic literature has emerged to document different kinds of shocks that persist. The mechanisms behind this persistence require further study.

### Proposed mechanisms of persistence

Agglomeration economies - the growth of a region compounding on top of some initial advantage - is a popular explanation for why some regions persist.

@bleakley_portage_2012 show that at sites in the United States where the cargo of barges had to be transferred across a waterfall during the 1800s persist as large metros today, though their economic advantage has long since faded.

### What remains?

Culture and occupational specialiation 

### Groupings of questions

Some questions that I find intersting revolve around the labour market, internal migration, and the ways in which regional development depends on a place's ability to retain the right kind of talent, or draw this in.
