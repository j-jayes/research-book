# Purpose

This book exists as a repository for my research process. The intent is to keep the ideas, discoveries and processes all in one place. This section discusses the context and larger project. The next sections show the thought process behind the progress so far in the data gathering phase. The book also includes a section on the courses that I plan to take and whose assignments I will include here.

## Project

The thesis research will form part of the project "Praise the people or praise the place: how culture and specialization drive long-term regional growth".

The project is about using micro-level data to better understand the mechanisms that drive long-term regional growth.

### Persistence and path-dependence in Sweden

The path of history can be interrupted by many different kinds of shocks. Some Swedish examples include the expansion of railway lines or the establishment of towns at the bequest of a king. These shocks can have lasting consequences that reach from history into the present day. A wealth of economic literature has emerged to document different kinds of shocks that persist. The mechanisms behind this persistence require further study.

### Proposed mechanisms of persistence

#### Agglomeration economies

Agglomeration economies - the growth of a region compounding on top of some initial advantage - is a popular explanation for why some regions persist.

@bleakley_portage_2012 show that at sites in the United States where the cargo of barges had to be transferred across a waterfall during the 1800s persist as large metros today, though their economic advantage has long since faded.

</div>

The argument put forward is that by creating an agglomeration at the portage site, the emergent city could draw in workers from surrounding areas to support the activities of the porters, diversifying the economic activity at the site. This created a positive feedback loop such that when technology advanced and portage was no longer necessary (railways replacing water transport) the city lived on.

#### Coordination

@cermeno_can_2019 show that coordination can serve as a mechanism through which cities persist despite unfavourable intial conditions. Examining towns granted monopoly trading rights in Sweden, @cermeno_can_2019 demonstrate that persistence can come about through the possibly arbitrary commitment of the Crown to nurture specific locations at the expense of other suitable choices, and that these chosen towns can persist as urban centres from the industrial revolution until today.

### First order conditions

Natural advantages in geography like port access and low disease burden. See hiroshima paper and AJR settler mortality.

### What remains?

Culture and occupational specialisation. In the thesis I will examine region specific cultures and fine occupations that can contribute to regional growth and persistence.
