## 1. Electrification as a shock to labour demand: worker skills and internal migration in Sweden

Electricity and the world wide web vie to be crowned the most important general purpose technology (GPT) widely adopted during the 20th century. Both dramatically reshaped the way in which our markets function for consumers and workers, and productivity increases which lagged behind the adoption of the GPTs raised living standards across the globe.

Electricity allowed firms to change their methods of production as it replaced steam power. Electricity acted both as a substitute and a complement for labour within these firms. The extent to which electricity changed the type of labour required by firms has bearing on the imminent adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the 21st century. Policy makers can better respond to the potential "hollowing-out" of the labour market (a bifurcation whereby high-skilled programmers at the top of the income distribution are vastly outnumbered by low-paid service workers at the bottom of the distribution) if we look back and learn from the past.

The first paper in the thesis will examine the expansion of the electricity network in Sweden, first from private provides and then the national grid, focussing on the shock that this provided to the kinds of skills workers needed to complement this new technology within firms. Sweden was an early adopter of electricity, benefiting from abundant hydro-power resources near to centres of population.

Using rich geographic data on the expansion of the electricity network in Sweden, I will assess how firms responded to the new technology as it was adopted. I will use census data to assess internal migration as a response to the new technology.

I will also make use of high frequency data on firm demand for certain skills that could not be met by the recruitment of local workers. The Riksvakanslistan are weekly records of demand for workers by occupation at the county level I plan to digitize.

Questions I would like to answer in this paper include:

1. Did electrification in early-adopter regions incentivise firms to source skilled labour from elsewhere in the country.
2. Did internal migration allow occupational specialization that compounded Marshall Arrow Romer (MAR) externalities, with firms making similar products locating nearby one another and taking advantage of the strong knowledge spillovers that come with localization. 
3. Was it instead upskilling of local workers that allowed Sweden's distinctive development of regionally specialised industries?

How did workers relocate? Where did they get funds from?

There are two competing forces changing the labour market: first, technological unemployment describes tasks that are replaced by machines while second, increasing specialization can cause unemployment, rather than a specific technological innovation. 

Other questions:

1. Can we find a specific technology to focus on within the electricity sector generally - perhaps in agriculture where there is a lot of employment. 

In a number of cases, e.g. Hillay Vipond's English boot makers, the innovation in terms of technology focussed the new jobs that were created in specific geographical locations (Northamptonshire and Leicestershire).

2. How did workers respond to the spatial and technological restructuring?

3. Did they relocate? how was relocation determined? Union membership - marital status... Requires linked census data.

## 2. What happens to a dream deferred? The social segregational consequences of the redevelopment of Norrmalm in Stockholm.

<blockquote>

What happens to a dream deferred?

Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun?
Or fester like a sore—
And then run?
Does it stink like rotten meat?
Or crust and sugar over—
like a syrupy sweet?

Maybe it just sags
like a heavy load.

Or does it *explode*?

The redevelopment of Norrmalm was an amendment to the city plan in Stockholm beginning in the 1950s that saw the relocation of many residential dwellings from within the city to suburban housing estates along subway lines and main highways in conjunction with the development of commercial real estate in the inner city. 

Modernist architectural ideals motivated for a separation of living and working, delegating living to commuting suburbs and working to inner city commercial real estate. However, the plan was not enacted completely. Pushback from residents resulted in only some areas (cite specifics here) being torn down in the city. This creates a lovely treatment and control group - with residents of inner city areas torn down being displaced and residents of undisturbed areas remaining in the city.

Questions I would like to answer:

1. What occupational segregation is there before and after the redevelopment? How can we measure this?
2. Did the new city plan have the desired effect regarding the creation of new suburbs that were more socially diverse than the neighbourhoods of the city it replaced?
3. How long did it take before the market sorting mechanism resulted in households relocating and decreasing the occupational and social diversity of the newly built suburban neighbourhoods.

The data required in this paper would be individual level register data on the inhabitants of Stockholm including education, income, household structure. Importantly in this paper it is not required that the data be linked over time - it may be enough to have just a snapshot of who lives where before and after the new city plan is enacted. Possible data options include the 1960, 1965, 1970 and 1975 census data collected by SCB but accessible through Riksarkivet.

Concern: this paper might be stepping on the toes of other researchers who have examined social mobility.

## 3. The Long And Winding Road: The mobility consequences of the redevelopment of Norrmalm in Stockholm.

How do different transportation technologies impact time spent commuting in Stockholm and the distance from your home to your work?

Can follow people in Stockholm with the Mantalängder and see both where they live and where they work. Then can draw maps of the commuting distance. See how this changes over time. Shock is different transport technologies.

Questions I would like to answer include:
1. How did changing transportation technologies enable better labour market matching? If we look at home address and work address, does the introduction of the subway for instance allow people with 
2. How does changing transport technology interact with the development of suburban housing estates? Do people with lower labour market incomes who are pushed out of the city during the redevelopment of Norrmalm relocate further away from their work places in the city centre?

Concerns: people who work as builders for instance will never work from their employer's head office as they always work on cite. In additio I need to see how long in time the Mantalängder go - if I can't get location information on home and work in the pre and post period this is obviously a failure.


## 4. Movin' Out: The labour market consequences of the redevelopment of Norrmalm in Stockholm.

It would be really lovely to complement the paper by @nakamura_gift_2021 that looks at the destruction of homes on a island in Iceland as a shock which pushed families to migrate into an urban area. The authors found that in this case, children in families who were shocked into moving saw higher education and labour market incomes throughought their life courses when compared to the children of families who remained on the island.

This paper could be an interesting complement looking at another shock - this time that pushed people out of the city and either into the suburbs or into other 

This would require linked register data on households who are displaced by the new city plan. It may require ethics clearance given that 

Questions that might be fun to answer include:

1. How does the shock of having your house destroyed
